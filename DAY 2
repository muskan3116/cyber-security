1. PHASES OF HACKING (HACKING CYCLE):
1. Reconnaisance : It is the process of gathering information about a target system to identify vulnerabilities and potential entry points. It's the first step in a cyber attack, and
it's often used by threat actors to plan how to exploit a system. 
2. Scanning : An automated process that looks for security issues in a web application. It's similar to a health screening, and can help identify vulnerabilities before they
become a threat.
3. Gaining access : Gaining access is a crucial step in cyber attacks, where a hacker or other malicious actor tries to enter a network or computer system without authorization.
4. Maintaining access : Hacker may just hack the system to show it was vulnerable or he can be so mischievous that he wants to maintain or persist the connection in the background 
without the knowledge of the user.
5. Clearing tracks : is the final stage of a successful hack attack, where the attacker removes evidence of their actions to avoid being caught. This involves removing or 
manipulating breadcrumbs, such as: IP addresses, Logs, Personal information, Leftover files or viruses.
2. DIRECTORY : 
A directory in Linux is a folder that organizes files and provides a hierarchical structure to the file system. In Linux, directories are similar to folders in Windows or Mac OS.
3. WHY EXTENSIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR A FILE TO OPEN ?
File extensions are important because they tell your computer which program is capable of opening a specific file, essentially acting as a label that identifies the file format 
and allows the correct application to be launched when you try to open it; without an extension, the operating system wouldn't know how to interpret the data within the file and 
wouldn't be able to display it properly.
4. WHAT IS GITHUB ?
GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control,
bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
5. INTRODUCTION TO LINUX COMMANDS : 
Linux commands are used to interact with Linux operating systems and servers. They can be used to access system resources, automate tasks, and perform complex operations. Here are some
common Linux commands: 
 Pwd
Prints the path of the current working directory. 
 Mkdir
Creates new directories. 
 Cp
Copies files or groups of files and directories. 
 Rm
Deletes files and folders within a directory.
6. WHAT IS RASPBERRY PIE ? HOW IT CAN BE USED IN CYBER SECURITY ?
The Raspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer that's used for a variety of purposes. 
Raspberry Pi can be used for a variety of cybersecurity projects, such as building a Kali Linux hacking lab, a honeypot, or a VPN. These projects can help you learn about computer networking,
programming languages, and operating systems, and can help you stand out to hiring managers.
7. UBUNTU : 
Ubuntu is a Linux distribution derived from Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is officially released in multiple editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for
Internet of things devices and robots.
8. INTRO TO DISCORD :
Discord is a popular online communication platform that allows users to interact through text, voice, and video calls, often used by gamers and communities to connect; in cybersecurity,
Discord can be a tool for threat intelligence gathering by monitoring public servers for malicious activity, but it also presents risks as cybercriminals frequently use it to distribute
malware, phishing links, and engage in scams, requiring careful consideration when accessing Discord for security purposes.
